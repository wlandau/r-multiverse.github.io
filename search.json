    "text": "Staging\nR-multiverse publishes a Production snapshot every 3 months. Staging is the gradual process that builds these snapshots. The goal of Staging is to ensure that packages and their dependencies are fully functional and mutually compatible in Production. Similar to the Debian release cycle, a special Staging repository slowly transforms a collection of unstable Community releases into a stable ecosystem of packages in Production.\nStaging happens in cycles. There are four cycles per year, and each cycle lasts three months. Each month is a distinct phase that gradually hardens the packages that will enter the snapshot.\n\nMonth 1: dependency freeze\nHere, the Staging repository freezes the versions of base R3 and packages from CRAN4. For the purpose of running and enforcing checks, these versions of dependencies do not change until after the snapshot is finalized on month 3 day 1. New Community package releases freely enter and leave the Staging repository. This process gives packages, contributors, and the Staging repository itself an entire month to adjust to a fixed and predictable set of dependencies.\n\n\nMonth 2: candidate freeze\nBeginning on month 2, newly registered packages can no longer enter the Staging repository. If a Staging repository package passes checks at least once during month 2, it immediately becomes staged. When a package becomes staged, its version freezes, and it can no longer upgrade in the Staging repository until the next 3-month cycle. A package can only upgrade in Staging if:\n\nIt is not already staged, and\nIts checks are failing.\n\nStaged packages appear on the Production status page and are guaranteed admittance into the next snapshot. If a package is already staged but its checks fail later in month 2, then the package is still staged and will still enter the upcoming snapshot.\n\n\nMonth 3: production snapshot\nThe Production snapshot finalizes on day 1 of month 3.5 Production does not add, remove, or update packages at any other time. 6 The snapshot consists of all staged packages from month 2. For the rest of month 3, the Staging repository does not change, and R-multiverse administrators have time to fix any rare and unexpected problems that may arise during the Staging process.\nPackages in the Staging repository repository do not change for the entire month. This gives the R-multiverse administrators time to fix rare and unexpected problems that may arise during the Staging process."

This would most commonly be by contributing a package at r-multiverse/contributions, where the Contributor is often the maintainer of the contributed package. Contributions may also take the form of feedback in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions in the r-multiverse/help repository, or more generally by answering questions from the community in this repository.\n\n\nModerator\nA Moderator is someone who has been invited by the R-multiverse Management Committee (RMC) to take on a moderator role. This entails certain rights and associated responsibilities which are outlined in full in the Review Policy, which may evolve over time. A Moderator may vet contributions and decide to admit or remove contributed packages from the repositories in accordance with the Review Policy. A Moderator may also moderate issues and discussions raised by Contributors in the r-multiverse/help repository or other forums on R-multiverse.\n\n\nAdministrator\nAn Administrator is a member of the R-multiverse Management Committee (RMC). Administrators have write access to all code repositories under the r-multiverse GitHub organization and maintain the infrastructure for the project. They have the right to create Proposals, cast votes on all Proposals on community-related decisions, the right to appoint Moderators, and the right to change the composition of the RMC itself.

For this, there is a second private GitHub repository accessible by administrators and moderators only.

The main role of the RMC is to further the long-term development and health of the community as a whole, and to ensure that balanced and broad-based user engagement and contributor participation takes place.\nAs part of this, the RMC has the sole authority to propose and approve changes to this governance document and all policies regarding operation of the R-multiverse GitHub repositories.\nThe RMC collectively appoint and delegate authority to moderators to perform a limited subset of duties.\nThe RMC is responsible for protecting the R-multiverse name, brand and reputation, and for enforcing adherence to this document.\nWhere this is jeopardised through the actions of an Administrator, Moderator or Contributor, the RMC will have the authority to immediately remove that person from their capacity in that role, not requiring the usual one month notice period for enacting Proposals.\n\n\nChanges to the RMC\nProposals to add or remove members of the RMC shall be put forward publicly by any member of the RMC, and shall be treated in the same way as any other Proposal, as described below.\n\n\nProposals\nAll changes to this governance document, or to a policy document such as the Code of Conduct or Review Policy that governs how the repositories operate will be posted for comment at the r-multiverse/help repository as a Proposal. All members of the community are invited to participate, and Proposals may be withdrawn or revised by their initial proposer as a result. Revisions likely to be regarded as material shall be proposed as a new Proposal, with reference to the preceding discussion.\nProposals will be deemed to have been adopted if both one calendar month has passed after notice has been publicly posted and either (i) there has been no dissent from from an administrator or (ii) dissent by an administrator was recorded and the Proposal has been passed after voting has taken place as per the Voting Process described below.\n\n\nVoting Process\nDecision-making is by consensus of the RMC as far as possible. All policy changes, including changes to this document, shall be posted publicly to the r-multiverse/help repository as a Proposal. If there is no dissent by another administrator, the Proposal comes into effect one calendar month after it is posted.\nIf there is dissent by an administrator, they should post a reasoned reply within the one calendar month notice period. However, no one administrator has a veto. Where there is dissent, voting shall take place among administrators to decide on an issue, with a simple majority of votes required for a Proposal to pass.\nAs illustration, if the total number of administrators is six, then at least four votes are required to pass a Proposal.\nIf a Proposal is passed, it will come into effect one calendar month after the Proposal was initially posted. If a Proposal is not passed within one calendar month of the posting of the Proposal, then the Proposal lapses and is not enacted until such a time that it passes.\nVoting shall take place publicly under the same Proposal that was initially posted."

(The patch version of R may change, but the major and minor versions do not change during a Staging cycle.)\n\nWhile Staging is active, if a package is failing one or more R-multiverse checks, then new releases of that package are continuously pulled from Community. Otherwise, if the package passes checks, then Staging freezes the package at its current release version and no longer accepts updates from Community. This freeze prevents new problems in reverse dependencies downstream.\nAt snapshot time, Production creates the snapshot from the subset of package releases in Staging which pass R-multiverse checks. A month after the snapshot, Staging resets (removes all its packages) so that an entirely new set of Community releases can become candidates for Production."

For example, if packages.json lists a dependency:\n  {\n    \"package\": \"polars\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars\",\n    \"branch\": \"a76b8d56e6f39a6157880069f9d32f3cc1f574d7\"\n  },\nthen you can install the version of that dependency from R:\npak::pkg_install(\"pola-rs/r-polars@a76b8d56e6f39a6157880069f9d32f3cc1f574d7\")\nthen restart R and run the following to reproduce the issue:\ndevtools::check(\"yourPackage\")\nAlternatively, you can create your own personal universe, give it a strategic subset of dependencies from packages.json, and omit the \"branch\" field from your package so the checks run on every commit.

Contributions may also take the form of feedback in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions in the r-multiverse/help repository, or more generally by answering questions from the community in this repository.\n\n\nModerator\nA Moderator is someone who has been invited by the R-multiverse Management Committee (RMC) to take on a moderator role. This entails certain rights and associated responsibilities which are outlined in full in the Review Policy, which may evolve over time. A Moderator may vet contributions and decide to admit or remove contributed packages from the repositories in accordance with the Review Policy. A Moderator may also moderate issues and discussions raised by Contributors in the r-multiverse/help repository or other forums on R-multiverse.\n\n\nAdministrator\nAn Administrator is a member of the R-multiverse Management Committee (RMC). Administrators have write access to all code repositories under the r-multiverse GitHub organization and maintain the infrastructure for the project. They have the right to create Proposals, cast votes on all Proposals on community-related decisions, the right to appoint Moderators, and the right to change the composition of the RMC itself.

For this, there is a second private GitHub repository accessible by administrators and moderators only. Policy violations are always reported publicly to https://github.com/r-multiverse/help after they are resolved, without disclosing the identities of the victims or Moderators involved.\n\nThe use of these two private repositories ensures that even confidential conversations remain accountable and open to audit.\nPrivate mailing lists are not used by the project.\n\n\nR-multiverse Management Committee (RMC)\nThe R-multiverse Management Committee (RMC) is responsible for the active management of the R-multiverse project. The main role of the RMC is to further the long-term development and health of the community as a whole, and to ensure that balanced and broad-based user engagement and contributor participation takes place.\nAs part of this, the RMC has the sole authority to propose and approve changes to this governance document and all policies regarding operation of the R-multiverse GitHub repositories.\nThe RMC collectively appoint and delegate authority to moderators to perform a limited subset of duties.\nThe RMC is responsible for protecting the R-multiverse name, brand and reputation, and for enforcing adherence to this document.\nWhere this is jeopardised through the actions of an Administrator, Moderator or Contributor, the RMC will have the authority to immediately remove that person from their capacity in that role, not requiring the usual one month notice period for enacting Proposals.\n\n\nChanges to the RMC\nProposals to add or remove members of the RMC shall be put forward publicly by any member of the RMC, and shall be treated in the same way as any other Proposal, as described below.\n\n\nProposals\nAll changes to this governance document, or to a policy document such as the Code of Conduct or Review Policy that governs how the repositories operate will be posted for comment at the r-multiverse/help repository as a Proposal. All members of the community are invited to participate, and Proposals may be withdrawn or revised by their initial proposer as a result. Revisions likely to be regarded as material shall be proposed as a new Proposal, with reference to the preceding discussion.\nProposals will be deemed to have been adopted if both one calendar month has passed after notice has been publicly posted and either (i) there has been no dissent from from an administrator or (ii) dissent by an administrator was recorded and the Proposal has been passed after voting has taken place as per the Voting Process described below.\n\n\nVoting Process\nDecision-making is by consensus of the RMC as far as possible. All policy changes, including changes to this document, shall be posted publicly to the r-multiverse/help repository as a Proposal. If there is no dissent by another administrator, the Proposal comes into effect one calendar month after it is posted.\nIf there is dissent by an administrator, they should post a reasoned reply within the one calendar month notice period. However, no one administrator has a veto. Where there is dissent, voting shall take place among administrators to decide on an issue, with a simple majority of votes required for a Proposal to pass.\nAs illustration, if the total number of administrators is six, then at least four votes are required to pass a Proposal.\nIf a Proposal is passed, it will come into effect one calendar month after the Proposal was initially posted. If a Proposal is not passed within one calendar month of the posting of the Proposal, then the Proposal lapses and is not enacted until such a time that it passes.\nVoting shall take place publicly under the same Proposal that was initially posted."

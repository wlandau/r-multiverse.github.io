R-multiverse originated from the R Consortium [Repositories Working Group](https://github.com/RConsortium/r-repositories-wg),
and it was supported by [R Consortium](https://r-consortium.org) ISC grant 24-ISC-1-05.
We would like to thank the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org) for this support in the development of R-multiverse.
